Load 06_aleav.sbk into User Bank 1.  You'll need to enable "Allow Wavetable
Synthesis Only" in the AWE32 Control Panel, to get full polyphony.  Yes, it
does make a difference.  I believe you can now get 31 voice polyphony in the
latest drivers by enabling wavetable synthesis only.  If you can't find it:
click on the Devices button inthe AWE32 Control Panel.

Autumn Leaves sounds best with the latest drivers.  The original midi file 
was a demo for the Yamaha's XG standard.  I converted the file to the AWE32,
and created the instruments.  The Brite Piano in the bank sounds very good.
It uses velocity sensitive filtering.  You can tell.  The piano sounds darker
at lower velocities, and bright and "hard" at higher velocities.

The instruments are mapped for General MIDI; The percussion is mapped for XG.
You can try playing it back without the SoundFont Bank, or on other synths to
compare.  But sounds best on the AWE32 with the SoundFont Bank :)

BTW Please don't re-use any of the instruments.  I will release a complete
Grand Piano bank at another time.  So don't be tempted to re-use it.

Enjoy!
