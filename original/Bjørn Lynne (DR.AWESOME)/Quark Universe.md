** QUARK UNIVERSE **

For the Soundblaster AWE32 with standard memory configuration of 512 kb.

By Bjorn Lynne, also known as DR.AWESOME

Taken from my latest CD "X2".

*****
This song uses it's own SoundFont file that must be uploaded to the
AWE32's RAM before playing the song. An AWE32 with the standard
memory configuration of 512 kb is sufficient.

1) Start the AWE32 Control Panel.

2) Make sure it's set to GM, *not* GS, as you need all the RAM for
   the SoundFont file.

3) In User Bank 1, locate the "AWEZENK.SBK" file, and double-click on
   it to uplod it to the soundcard's RAM.

4) Now play the song from any MIDI player, like MediaPlayer or
   Cakewalk*.

* If you use Cakewalk, you will also need to change the way that
Cakewalk handles bank-changes. Go to the Settings menu and select
Instruments, Define Instruments, Bank Select Method = "Controller 0
Only". You only need to do this ONCE, so if you've done it before,
don't worry about it.

Please note, the full CD version of this song sounds a lot cooler.
This "cheap" AWE32 version is just an attempt to recreate some of the
original, which is in full studio production including analog synths
etc. etc.
