        Thanks to the AWEJammers for their support and technical help, as regards
        the Amerissium Project.  This is the result, albeit no lyrics as of yet.

        Dedicated to Claire O'Leary, for giving me back my inspiration and drive.
        I wondered for six years what gave me the need and the ability to write
        music, and one day it finally dawned on me.  How I could not have put these
        two things together earlier, I do not know...
