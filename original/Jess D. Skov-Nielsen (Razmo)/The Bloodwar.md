## Text from the Creative Open MIDI Contest Winner's Page

This tune is inspired from the AD\&D; world "Planescape" where there is an eternal battle between hundreds of demons and devils of hell called "The Bloodwar". The instruments are mainly huge orchestral instruments like strings, trumpets, choirs etc. but the tune has a surprise for you at the end. Yep! Razmo did it again... could not help it!!! All sounds are home-made (of course). Notice also the "Speech" from one of the denizens of hell. I recorded my own voice and heavily processed it. The speech goes like this : "They're gonna give him the rope if he doesn't pay the music - well, actually they won't give him the rope; They'll put it around his neck - except he's got no neck, so they might just have to give him the rope instead. - what kind of music does he listen to anyway?"
