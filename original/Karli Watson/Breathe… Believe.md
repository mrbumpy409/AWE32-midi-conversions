             Breathe... Believe.

          by Karli Watson October '95

This is my first attempt at songwriting with an AWE32. I
have used junglist style loops in an ambient framework to,
I think, good effect. I have written other (better) pieces 
since, but I think I'll keep them to myself for the moment.

Most of the samples except the drum loop and TR909 sounds 
are home made, by breath / vocals + effects.

Any queries / comments to:

## Conversion Notes

Altered the MIDI file to access its sounds in bank 1 instead of bank 0.
