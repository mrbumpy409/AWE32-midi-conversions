To hear this track correctly, load 1997.sbk into user bank #1 on your
Sound Blaster AWE32 or AWE64 with 1MB of ram on board only, it's not a 
large bank but it's worth it!

Be sure that the bank change are set on controller 0 only, in the
setup window.  It might not work properly if it's not done right and
what you will hear is not going to be really fun.

Here's a hint how to know if it's set correctly yet: If you hear a
cymbal on the first beat it's because it's o.k.  If not, try to
configure Cakewalk for the bank changes as written precedently.

Another thing, My Awe32 is on port #2 so if yours is on another port,
you might need to change that too, but every one know how to do it.

So enjoy the track and if you have problems with it and you need more 
instructions, write me at little@globetrotter.qc.ca and i'll make sure 
to write back with the solution to your problem.  I'm a Cakewalk 3.0 
expert so ask anything you want.

I'd like you to read the notes that will appear when you load the
track so you will be more into the "Minding" while you listen to it.

Enjoy.
                        Little Eric!
