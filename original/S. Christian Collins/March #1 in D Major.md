Entry Title : March #1 in D major
Description of Entry : March for classical orchestra.  Standard scoring.

(In 50 words, tell us what is your song all about, how do you compose it, 
what instruments do you use?) 

I used a 486 40mhz PC, Cakewalk 3.0, and an AWE32 to compose and score the 
music.  In order to make a demo tape, I had to play each of the parts 
separately into Cakewalk.  I used all of the standard orchestral 
instruments minus the English horn and harp.  The AWE32 worked great for 
helping me guess what a real orchestra would sound like.  This past summer,
my march was performed by the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra at Madison in 
their "Concerts on the Square" series.

                           ===================

Please make sure the following settings are correct:

Reverb Type: Hall 2
Chorus Type: Chorus 3

EMU8000 Treble : 0db
EMU8000 Bass : 0db
        (note: these are not found in the mixer, but in the AWE Control 
        Panel)

To get maximum polyphony, please check the "Allow Wavetable Synthesis Only"
checkbox (under the 'devices' button).  I have tested it with only 30 voices
and have not heard any note cutoff, but that may not be the case with every 
machine.

Thank you!

Samuel Christian Collins
