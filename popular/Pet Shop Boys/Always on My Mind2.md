  LYRICS:
  ------
Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Little things I should've said and done, I never took the time
     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best, I'm so sorry, I was blind
     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind

          Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
          Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
          Satisfied

Little things I should've said and done, I never took the time
     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind

          Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
          Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied

     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind
     You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
